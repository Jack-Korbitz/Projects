# ðŸ“Œ Project 1: National Risk Index

**Description:**  
This project leverages the FEMA National Risk Index (NRI) dataset to visualize and explore natural hazard risk across the United States. The NRI provides a comprehensive, county-level assessment of 18 natural hazards, community resilience, expected annual losses, and social vulnerability metrics.

**Purpose:**  
The goal of this project is to develop a **Tableau dashboard** that enables interactive exploration of natural hazard risks by geography and hazard type. The visualization will help identify high-risk areas and inform mitigation strategies based on layered risk components.

**Dataset Source:**  
- **FEMA National Risk Index**: [https://hazards.fema.gov/nri](https://hazards.fema.gov/nri)

**Key Features of the Dataset:**
- Covers all U.S. counties and Census tracts.
- Includes metrics such as:
  - **Expected Annual Loss (EAL)** from natural hazards
  - **Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)**
  - **Community Resilience Index (CRI)**
  - **Overall Risk Scores** for 18 hazard types (e.g., floods, earthquakes, wildfires)
- Contains both raw scores and percentile rankings for comparative analysis.

**Tools Used:**  
- Tableau
